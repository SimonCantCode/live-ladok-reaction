# Live Ladok reaction - Overview
Have you ever failed a course only to think "Man, I wish this was more humiliating". Well then you're in luck! Introducing the live Ladok reaction, an extension (really just a script) that adds a GIF of a cat laughing hysterically at you in case you fail a course or test in Ladok. See figure 1 for an example screenshot.

Additional features include changing the text from "UnderkÃ¤nd" to "Uruselt nollan!" as well as displaying the [high five](https://youtu.be/HPdURyombM0) GIF from Breaking bad. You probably won't be seeing that last feature though (ðŸ¤£ðŸ«µðŸ¥€). Also, all of this is still kinda beta testing, I can't know for sure if it even works untill next time I get test results lol.

## Installation
Since I was too lazy to make this into a real extension, you will have to import it to your browser using a userscript manager like Greasemonkey, there are many other better tutorials on how to do this. Please do note that this script was written for the Swedish version of Ladok. You will have to edit the code slightly for it to work in other languages.
